# DoordashVR
This was a prototype for an Environments Studio III at CMU. This project was about creating a branded experience for an assigned brand. For me, it was Doordash Picnicâ€“ a pop-up experience located in Pittsburgh. Visitors to a platform with a telescope, and once they look inside the telescope they find an augmented recreation of Pittsburgh. By pointing the telescope, they can find out about hidden gems around the city and order from them, taking away both an enriching experience about food and a learning about how Doordash connects people in neighborhoods. 

Eventually, I ported this prototype using a mouse cursor to the Oculus Quest 2 and created a semi-functional cardboard mockup of what it would look like in real life. I'll post an update / documentation eventually on my website!

Also, the initial commit messages say Davis2600, but I was using a computer that he was logged onto to work on this project. All the code is written by me! (Bryce)

# Setting up
This project requires LFS. 

I have not tried building this project, as it was only a prototype, you will have to use the preview play mode on an Oculus.
